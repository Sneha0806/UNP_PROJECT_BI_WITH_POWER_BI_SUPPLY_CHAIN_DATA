# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP. The Supply Chain Dashboard provides insights about how to increase the efficiency of inventory and logistics . We have first understood the data,Imported raw data from Excel and ensured data consistency while importing, handling missing or corrupted files,Removed duplicate records and handled missing values and applied data validation rules to ensure accuracy, fixed inconsistencies 
(e.g., multiple spellings of supplier names), we have found that there was no need to prepare data model , we have then continue by making important metrics like Total Revenue ,Total Cost and Total Profit and designed bar charts, pie charts,and donut charts ,like Total revenue by product type,location ,total sales by product type and location,shipping cost by carriers,product type and trasportation modes,defect rates ,inspection rates and used added slicers for dynamic filtering implemented drop-down lists and interactive buttons for user-friendly navigation slicers like routes , customer demographics, product type, shipping carriers ,location for making the data more impactful,regarding product performance,Inventory & Logistics and Suppiers & Quality Control and designed a clean, professional layout for readability dashboard , which helps in better decisions making for the business.
